# Node Scenario: CPU Consumption

This scenario will introduce a spike in CPU usage approximately every hour for the node it is deployed to.

## Deploy Instructions

Upload the `consume-cpu.sh` and `setup.sh` scripts to the home directory (`/home/ec2-user`) of the target node.
Then run the `setup.sh` script via `sudo ./setup.sh`.
