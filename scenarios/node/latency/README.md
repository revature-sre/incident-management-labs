# Node Scenario: Network Latency

This scenario will introduce a spike in network latency approximately every hour for the node it is deployed to.

## Deploy Instructions

Upload the `cause-latency.sh` and `setup.sh` scripts to the `/usr/local/etc/` directory of the target node.
Then run the `setup.sh` script via `sudo ./setup.sh`.
